Source code related to the paper "Behavior Knowledge Space-Based Fusion for Copy-Move Forgery Detection"

Author: Anselmo Ferreira

INSTRUCTIONS

The source code is divided in two parts:

1. Reproduce Experiments: you can re-run our experiments and check the eddectiveness of our proposed approach in a 5X2 cross validation scenario on the CPHPALL dataset. Results can vary a little bit depending on the precison used to calculate the probabilities.

2.Do your own BKS: Here you can check how the multiscale BKS is built and also can change the code to include your images and/or compare your approach against ours.

In both cases you must download a folder called aux. Available to download in

Please extract this folder in the same folder as the two folders extracted here are in your PC.

Any question, problems or suggestions can be reported to me.
