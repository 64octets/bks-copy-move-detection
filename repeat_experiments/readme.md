INSTRUCTIONS

Basically this code will run the experiments we did in our paper. There is one folder for our multiscale BKS using supoort vector regression and another using our multiscale BKS using random forests regression.
Results can vary according to the precision your CPU uses to calculate the probabilities.

Please let me know if you are facing problems running the code. My e-mail is anselmo.ferreira@gmail.com
